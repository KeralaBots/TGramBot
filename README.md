# TGramBot

TGramBot is a partially auto-generated and asynchronous Minimal [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) framework in Python for bots

This library is inspired by a number of other libraries:

- [Gotgbot](https://github.com/PaulSonOfLars/gotgbot), [telegram-bot-api-spec](https://github.com/PaulSonOfLars/telegram-bot-api-spec) by [Paul Larsen
](https://github.com/PaulSonOfLars)
- [aiogram](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram)

Special thanks to [Paul Larsen
](https://github.com/PaulSonOfLars) for his libraries

__**This Library is still in its Alpha phase**__

Most of the methods and types using in this library are auto-generated by scraping the official documentation of Telegram Bot Api

So the chance of getting bugs and errors are high. So please let us know through the [issue section](https://github.com/KeralaBots/TGramBot/issues) about the bug you have encountered.
